**👋 Hey, I’m Chiebuka (Ebuka)**

Product-minded software engineer who likes shipping real things, cutting scope, and fixing what actually blocks users.

Currently building:
- 🏋🏽 **Helthy** — fitness platform with 800+ users (workouts + nutrition in one flow)
- 💇🏽 **Krown** — booking + operations for beauty professionals in Nigeria
- ⚙️ **Refactr** — high-volume file conversion web app

I care about:
- activation & retention > feature count
- simple systems over clever ones
- talking to users before building

Tech I use a lot:
TypeScript, Python, SQL · React · Node.js · PostgreSQL · Docker
